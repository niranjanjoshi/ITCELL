Hereâ€™s a quick outline of the how the GitHub Flow works using just a browser:

Create a branch right from the repository.
Create, edit, and delete files, rename them, or move them around.
Send a pull request from your branch with your changes to kick off a discussion.
Continue making changes on your branch as needed, updating the pull request automatically.
Once the branch is ready to go, the pull request can be merged using the big green button.
Branches can then be tidied up using the delete buttons in the pull request, or on the branches page.
Repeat.
